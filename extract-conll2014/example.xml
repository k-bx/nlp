         <TITLE>Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing</TITLE>
         <P>What is genetic risk? Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease. People get certain disease because of genetic changes. How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear. If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease. The opposite is also true. If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it is still possible that you develop heart disease. However for some rare diseases, people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease. When we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease, are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives? My answer is no.</P>
         <P>On one hand, we do not want this potential danger causing firghtenning affects in our families' later lives. When people around us know that we got certain disease, their altitudes will be easily changed, whether caring us too much or keeping away from us. And both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people. Surrounded by such concerns, it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems. It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life, because we will never know when the ''potential bomb'' will explode.</P>
         <P>On the other hand, if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease, we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family. For an example, if exercising is helpful for family potential disease, we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise. And we keep track of all family members health conditions. At the same time, we are prepared to know when there are other members got this disease.</P>
         <P>Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue. Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings, there currently is no legal requirement to do so. In fact, requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious."</P>
         <P>Nothing is absolute right or wrong. If certain disease genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others, it is OK to disclose the result. Above all, life is more important than secret.</P>
