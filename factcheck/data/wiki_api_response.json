This is, however, in a rather narrow sense, the truth. […] the ideology of Judaism remains a lightning rod for intolerance to this day. […] Jews, insofar as they are religious, believe that they are bearers of a unique covenant with God. As a consequence, they have spent the last two thousand years collaborating with those who see them as different by seeing themselves as irretrievably so. Judaism is as intrinsically divisive, as ridiculous in its literalism, and as at odds with the civilizing insights of modernity as any other religion. Jewish settlers, by exercising their \"freedom of belief\" on contested land, are now one of the principal obstacles to peace in the Middle East.}}\n\nRegarding Israel and Judaism, Harris has said, \"I don't think Israel should exist as a Jewish state. I think it is obscene, irrational and unjustifiable to have a state organized around a religion. So I don't celebrate the idea that there's a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. I certainly don't support any Jewish claims to real estate based on the Bible. Though I just said that I don't think Israel should exist as a Jewish state, the justification for such a state is rather easy to find. We need look no further than the fact that the rest of the world has shown itself eager to murder the Jews at almost every opportunity. So, if there were going to be a state organized around protecting members of a single religion, it certainly should be a Jewish state. Now, friends of Israel might consider this a rather tepid defense, but it's the strongest one I've got. I think the idea of a religious state is ultimately untenable.\"<ref>Harris, Sam (July 27, 2014). [http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/why-dont-i-criticize-israel \"Why Don’t I Criticize Israel?\"].

It depends on many factors—ranging from genetics and neurobiology to sociology and economics.\" Harris says that it is time to promote a [[science of morality|scientific approach to normative morality]], rejecting the idea that religion determines what is good. He believes that once scientists begin proposing moral norms in papers, supernatural moral systems will join \"[[astrology]], [[witchcraft]] and [[Greek mythology]] on the scrapheap\".<ref name=\"newscientist.com\">{{cite web |author=Harris, Sam |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827822.100-morality-we-can-send-religion-to-the-scrapheap.html |title=Morality: 'We can send religion to the scrap heap' |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=October 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Free will===\nHarris says the idea of free will \"cannot be mapped on to any conceivable reality\" and is incoherent.<ref>Pardi, Paul (May 15, 2012).

[https://www.bigquestionsonline.com/content/does-contemporary-neuroscience-support-or-challenge-reality-free-will \"Does Contemporary Neuroscience Support or Challenge the Reality of Free Will?\"] Big Questions Online.</ref> People's thoughts and intentions, Harris says, \"emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control.\" Every choice we make is made as a result of preceding causes. These choices we make are determined by those causes, and are therefore not really choices at all. Harris also draws a distinction between conscious and unconscious reactions to the world. Harris argues that this realization about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.\n\n===Social and economic politics===\nHarris describes himself as a liberal, and states that he supports raising [[graduated income tax|taxes]] on the very wealthy, the [[Drug liberalization|decriminalizing of drugs]] and [[same-sex marriage]]. He was critical of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s [[war in Iraq]], fiscal policy, and treatment of science.<ref>Harris, Sam (September 18, 2006).

For both groups, statements of belief (sentences judged as either true or false) were associated with increased activation of [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], a region of the brain involved in emotional judgment, processing uncertainty, assessing rewards and thinking about oneself.<ref name=\"HealyLATimes\" />  A \"comparison of all religious trials to all nonreligious trials produced a wide range of signal differences throughout the brain,\" and the processing of religious belief and empirical belief differed in significant ways.
