A mock object may have many methods, and not all of them are that interesting. For example, in some tests we may not care about how many times `GetX()` and `GetY()` get called.

If you are lucky, the mocks you need to use have already been implemented by some nice people. If, however, you find yourself in the position to write a mock class, relax - Google Mock turns this task into a fun game! (Well, almost.)
If you do not wish to use the Public Suffix List, you may remove the
If you put your tests in a static library (not DLL) then `__declspec(dllexport)` is not required. Now, in your main program, write a code that invokes that function:
If you put your tests into a library and your `main()` function is in a different library or in your .exe file, those tests will not run. The reason is a [bug](https://connect.microsoft.com/feedback/viewfeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=244410&siteid=210) in Visual C++. When you define your tests, Google Test creates certain static objects to register them. These objects are not referenced from elsewhere but their constructors are still supposed to run. When Visual C++ linker sees that nothing in the library is referenced from other places it throws the library out. You have to reference your library with tests from your main program to keep the linker from discarding it. Here is how to do it. Somewhere in your library code declare a function:
If you want to use something other than Google Test (e.g. [CppUnit](http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/cppunit/index.php?title=Main_Page) or

I get a heap check failure when using a mock object, but using a real object is fine.  What can be wrong? ##
Ignoring an Action's Result ##
Ignoring Arguments in Action Functions ##
Ignoring Uninteresting Calls ##
I got a warning "Uninteresting function call encountered - default action taken.."  Should I panic? ##
I have a failed test where Google Mock tells me TWICE that a particular expectation is not satisfied.  Isn't this redundant? ##
I have a fixture class Foo, but TEST\_F(Foo, Bar) gives me error "no matching function for call to Foo::Foo()". Why? ##
I have a huge mock class, and Microsoft Visual C++ runs out of memory when compiling it.  What can I do? ##
I have an interface that has several implementations. Can I write a set of tests once and repeat them over all the implementations? ##
I have several test cases which share the same test fixture logic, do I have to define a new test fixture class for each of them? This seems pretty tedious. ##

Lemmatization
Let's look at an example. Suppose you are developing a graphics program that relies on a LOGO-like API for drawing. How would you test that it does the right thing? Well, you can run it and compare the screen with a golden screen snapshot, but let's admit it: tests like this are expensive to run and fragile (What if you just upgraded to a shiny new graphics card that has better anti-aliasing? Suddenly you have to update all your golden images.). It would be too painful if all your tests are like this. Fortunately, you learned about Dependency Injection and know the right thing to do: instead of having your application talk to the drawing API directly, wrap the API in an interface (say, `Turtle`) and code to that interface:

RUTILS is a syntactic utilities package for Common Lisp
`s3_cache.py` is used to cache the npm packages that our Grunt tasks depend on and the RubyGems that Jekyll depends on. (Jekyll is needed to compile our docs to HTML so that we can run them thru an HTML5 validator.)
`s3_cache.py` is used to speed up Bootstrap's Travis builds. Installing npm packages and RubyGems used to take up a significant fraction of our total build times. Also, at the time that `s3_cache.py` was written, npm was occasionally unreliable.
`s3_cache.py` maintains a cache, stored in an Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket, of a given directory whose contents are considered non-critical and are completely & solely determined by (and should be able to be regenerated from) a single given file.

When using Google Mock, do I have to use Google Test as the testing framework?  I have my favorite testing framework and don't want to switch. ##

Where to Put It ##
Who Is Using Google Test? ##
Why are death tests implemented as assertions instead of using a test runner? ##
Why aren't Google Test assertions implemented using exceptions? ##
Why does ASSERT\_DEATH complain about previous threads that were already joined? ##
Why does Google Test require the entire test case, instead of individual tests, to be named FOODeathTest when it uses ASSERT\_DEATH? ##
Why does Google Test support EXPECT\_EQ(NULL, ptr) and ASSERT\_EQ(NULL, ptr) but not EXPECT\_NE(NULL, ptr) and ASSERT\_NE(NULL, ptr)? ##
Why don't Google Test run the tests in different threads to speed things up? ##
Why don't we use structs as test fixtures? ##
Why do we use two different macros for tests with and without fixtures? ##
Why Google Mock? #
Why is it not recommended to install a pre-compiled copy of Google Test (for example, into /usr/local)? ##
Why is `s3_cache.py` necessary?
Why not cl-ev?
Why should I prefer test fixtures over global variables? ##
Why should I use Google Test instead of my favorite C++ testing framework? ##
Why should not test case names and test names contain underscore? ##
